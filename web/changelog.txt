*<b>This version is for Minecraft 1.10.2, and carries on from the latest release of <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/botania-unofficial">Botania Unofficial</a>.</b>
*<b>A massive thanks is due to <a href="https://twitter.com/williewillus">williewillus</a>, who took it upon himself to port and maintain the mod all the way through 1.8, 1.9 and to 1.10. Please go send him love and hugs, as us being here would not be possible without him.</b>
*<b>If you want to know what changed in between, have a look through the Releases page on <a href="https://github.com/williewillus/Botania/releases">williewillus/Botania.</a></b>
*<b>This is the first release for 1.10.2, which sets up for further content expansion, while removing obsolete and bloated pieces of content. More content is planned and will be coming soon.</b>
*<b>You can mitigate your worlds from Botania Unofficial to Botania just fine, any of the removed pieces of content you had in your world will just disappear.</b>
*<b>A few pieces of content from Botania's 1.7.10 releases was removed in Botania Unofficial due to them being added to <a href="http://quark.vazkii.us/">Quark</a>, another mod by me which I highly recommend you install alongside Botania.</b>
*<b>If you were looking for BotaniaV2, most of that project was scrapped in favour of this update instead. I decided that instead of reinventing a mod that's already good, I'd use the concepts there to make a new mod instead, which I am planning, but want to get some new stuff onto Botania and Quark before I move onto that.</b>
*<b>And that's it for my important note. I'm back to Botania, and I hope you carry on enjoying it.</b>

*[API] Added IManaTooltipDisplay for items that display a mana bar on the tooltip.
*[API] Added getTagline() to LexiconEntry.

r1.7 225
*Added Shimmerrock and Shimmerwood Planks, rainbow blocks made with Bifrost Blocks.
*Added the Rafflowsia, a new flower that eats passive flowers for mana. And you thought they were useless!
*Fixed some entries telling you to go to "Magical Apparatus" when the section is actually called "Natural Apparatus".
*Flowers can now be dyed using Floral Powder.
*The Dandelifeon produces a lot more mana per cell now, however, whenever a cell is eaten, the board is wiped. Also added an "warning: experimental" page to the entry.<i>As always, this is still not final.</i>
*[API] Fixed API dependency on non-API Botania classes.
*[API] Increased version number to 65
r1.7 224
*Added "Motif" variants of passive flowers. Same as Petite, but instead of being smaller, they don't decay nor produce mana. Since they use the same system, you can find them in the Flower Shrinking page.
*Added "Redstone Helper" features to the Manaseer Monocle. Looking at redstone things will show you some data about them.
*Added a recipe counter to the recipe registing code just for fun. You can now see how many recipes botania adds, woohoo.

*Added two new Portuguese Pavement Colors, yellow and green.
*Changed some checks to use Material instead of Block (such as Hydroangeas and Thermalilies). Should make compatibility with TerraFirmaCraft or other mods' different water and lava blocks work better.
*Changed the "no mana killzone" of the Dandelifeon from a 5x5 to a 7x7. <i>To be honest, I really don't know where I'm going with this one. It's seeming to me like it's a failed experiment, as the optimal build always ends up being a really simple thing, which I'm not a big fan of. I'm just trying various things and seeing what sticks. I might end up removing it alltogether.</i>
*Changed the Gaia Guardian's health to 800 (from 300) and the damage cap to 35 (from 12), 50 if it's a crit. In a way, if you're properly prepared, the boss is actually easier now as it's definitely possible to hit that hard with the proper enchants and potions, it just requires preparation.
*Fixed the Corporea Crystal Cube and Hovering Hourglass not rendering every model piece in the inventory.
*Fixed the Elementium Axe dropping Zombie Heads from Zombie Pigmen.
*Fixed typos.

*The Corporea Index is now less stingy on how close you need to be to it in the Y axis.

*[API] Added ICorporeaRequestor for use with the Corporea Retainer.
*[API] Increased version number to 64.
r1.7 223
*Added code to safely crash the game if someone overrides the Botania API's Internal Method Handler. Overriding the Internal Method Handler is a sure fire way to crash the game or cause incompatibility problems later down the line, so at least you're getting informed about it with a proper error message. It's sad that I even had to makXe this, to be honest.
*Fixed a circular dependency chain with DragonAPI not allowing for the game to load.
*Fixed Red Stringed Conparators only seeing half of a double chest.
*Reused old botania shaders as new tiny potato variants. <i>You know, this whole potato variant thing is starting to become a good stress relief measure.</i>

You can read about this change and why I made it <a href="http://vazkii.us/uncategorized/sins-of-a-solar-empire-or-the-passive-generation-conundrum/">right here</a>.
*Some Dandelifeon tweaks, the 5x5 area around it will no longer kill generation 1 cells, the output rate has been lowered a bit and the recipe for Cellular Blocks has been changed.
*Sparks now produce less, but bigger, particles to make it less likely to reach the particle limit.
*The Mana Pool's "water" icon is now a different icon and not the one used for water. (it still looks the same, it's just in a different file)
*The Ring of Magnetism now has a limit of 200 entities it can pull so it doesn't kill your FPS if you manage to get a lot of items in one place for whatever reason.
*The Thorn and Flare Chakrams now pass through leaves and folliage.

*Made the Dandelifeon's texture not be as horrid as the one I made while wiiv was away :V
r1.7 220
*Added more taters.
*Added the Dandelifeon, a new generating flower for maniacs that utilizes Conway's Game of Life.

*Capped the flower patch size config option to 8 blocks to prevent worldgen crashes when the generator seeps into other chunks and forces the world to generate a new chunk while already generating one.

*Fixed an exploit that made the Exoflame ridiculously fuel efficient.
r1.7 218
*Fixed the Black Hole Talisman crashing the game if used on lit redstone.

*Increased the incense plate range to 30 blocks (from 24).
r1.7 217

*Added the Manatide Bellows, a block that increases the speed of Mana Pools' mana output and Furnaces' smelting.
*Bifrost Blocks are now craftable using a Rod of the Bifrost and Alfglass (you don't lose the rod). They also have a smoother animation now thanks to the interpolated icon (same as the one used for prismarine) and emit light.

*Petal and Rune recipe pages now animate a lot smoother.
*Pixies (friendly and hostile) are now forced to despawn if they exist for more than 10 seconds.
*The Head Creation page now links to the <a href="http://heads.freshcoal.com/usernames.php">player head database</a> to give you ideas on what cool stuff you can do with heads.
*The high council of Elven Garde, after having received countless unintended "gifts" of unenchanted Iron Ingots, Diamonds and Ender Pearls from unskilled skim-reading botanists are now returning those back to the senders.
*Tweaked the Elven Portal's render a bit. The lighting on it doesn't spazz out and it renders properly when you're in it now.
r1.7 214
*Added a little bar to the Flugel Tiara's flight HUD that shows the dash cooldown.
*Added a notification to the lexicon's main page when the mod updates to let you know things have changed and not to panic if something doesn't work as it used to.

*Updated recipes to use the newer ore dictionary keys. (Adaptivity)
r1.7 212
*Added the Greater Ring of Magnetization with a larger range. Big magnet!
*Fixed giving another player a relic ring crashing their client.
*Fixed the Rod of the Depths not showing infinite cobblestone when used with the Rod of the Shifting Crust, but rather, infinite dirt.
*Fixed the Rod of the Shifting Crust placing fake blocks in the client side.
*Mana Lenses can now be made with Glass as well as Glass Panes, because if you're low enough that you can't make panes it becomes a pain. <i>Ha, I made a funny.</i>
r1.7 211
*Added even MORE tiny potato variants :D
*Added Grass conjuration recipe.
*Added Mithril and Platinum ores to the orechid's list. (phantamanta44)
*Added the Rod of the Shifting Crust, effectively a copy of the Thaumcraft Wand of Equal trade with a few new things added on.
*Changed the Rune of Sloth in the Orechid recipe to a Rune of Greed. <i>Turns out I planned the rune recipes really poorly, the only thing you could make with the greed rune for the longest time was the bore lens. Since the new rod uses a sloth rune I moved this around and now all is balanced :D</i>

*Fixed more typos.
*Fixed the Corporea Index kicking you out of the server if you try requesting an item with control codes in the name (such as brews).

*Fixed the Flugel Tiara's sprint delay being 1.5 seconds rather than the intended 3 seconds, also changed it to 2 seconds, so the intended is now 2 seconds rather than 3 seconds. So this line should read "Fixed the Flugel Tiara's sprint delay being 1.5 seconds rather than the intended 2 seconds", but the intended was 3 seconds before and 2 seconds now because 2 seconds feels better than 3 seconds. I don't even know.
*Fixed the Hand of Ender being stackable.
*Fixed the Hovering Hourglass accepting any item through automation and not just sand and not syncing its contents properly when its inventory is changed through automation.
*Fixed the name suffix of the Black Hole Talisman not using the block's damage value to get the name.

*Added the ability for botania armor and baubles to have Thaumcraft runic shielding. (ruifung)
*Added the Slime in a Bottle, effectively a slime chunk detector.
*Added the Starcaller by very popular request. A new sword that makes shooting stars. Yes, it's the Starfury/Star Wrath from terraria.

*Changed the element and season runes' textures to new versions in Sosho by miznib.
*Changed the hardcore passive generation value to 48000 by default instead of 24000. <i>It was supposed to be that to begin with but I can't do math.</i>

*Passive flowers now get replaced with Dead Bushes when they despawn rather than getting removed altogether.
*Prismarine now animates properly.

*[API] Changed the SubTileGenerating despawn to place a dead bush instead of air.

*[API] Increased version number to 59.
r1.7 208
*Added the ability to transmute between all vanilla flowers with the alchemy catalyst.
*Added the vanilla Coarse Dirt to the botania creative tab, because ya know, it's craftable with botania and stuff.

*Changed the Cocoon of Caprice's texture to be 64x32 rather than 48x32, that apparently was making it not display properly in some setups.

*Fixed the Cocoon of Caprice not saving its data properly. (Titanium237458)

It can still accept larger fuels, but they are capped to a Coal Block. <i>Now, before you start raging and raising your pitchforks around at this, please think about what botania tries to do, and how much super condensed fuels like Aeternalis Fuel Blocks negate that. Ok, you chill now?</i>

*Fixed luminizers sometimes getting unbound on chunkload.
*Fixed torches not being able to be placed on top of botania walls. (TheWhiteWolves)
*Functional and Generating Flowers no longer rebind to the closest spreader/pool if the one they were bound to stops existing. Instead, they'll keep the binding in the position and wait for a new spreader/pool to appear there. Of course you can still rebind manaully. This is a workaround for the bug where flowers would lose or change their binding on chunk unload, which is hopefully fixed now :T

r1.7 202
*Added a /botania-skyblock-spread command for server owners. It sends the target player randomly into the world and created a GoG skyblock for them.

*<b>Rebalanced mana generation.</b> All values are relative to the values previous to this release. These numbers may change back slightly if any of the changes proves too drastic.<ul><li>Dayblooms had their delay reduced, now 20% faster overall.</li><li>Nightshades produce exactly as much as Dayblooms. So 140% faster overall.</li><li>Hydroangeas will instantly grab water after they're done with the last drink. A single block of water lasts for 4x as long to prevent sound/update spam. 127% faster overall.</li><li>Rosa Arcanas will produce twice as much mana per XP point. They also have 4x as much of an internal buffer. 100% faster overall.</li><li>Endoflames had no changes.</li><li>Munchdews had the amount that a leaf produces increased tenfold and their internal buffer increased fiftyfold. If they spend more than 5 ticks without eating any leaves they'll go in a 80 second cooldown period. 900% faster overall.</li><li>Gourmaryllises have a higher multiplier for the amount that a piece of food produces and a larger internal buffer. 255% faster overall.</li><li>Narslimmuses have a higher multiplier for the amount that a slime produces. 412% faster overall.</li><li>Thermalilies had their cooldown lowered from 8 minutes to 6 minutes. 31% (+ a negligible number thanks to inheriting the dilligence upgrade from the Hydroangeas) faster overall.</li><li>Entropinnyums had no changes.</li><li>Kekimuruses had their cooldown increased and amount of mana per slice drastically increased. 75% faster and 181 more resource efficient.</li><li>Spectrolususe had no changes.</li></ul>

*Rewrote the text rendering algorithm for the Lexica Botania's text pages to be less of a mess and not bug out around some formatting codes.
r1.5 168
*Fixed a (recurring) crash with the Gaia Guardian that would happen if there were no players around it. Naturally this only affected servers, but it's a big problem so I decided to make a build to fix it. <i>And it was also crashing forgecraft :T</i>
r1.5 167
*Added a Word Counter thing that gets written to the log saying how many words the Lexica Botania has. <i>Don't ask me why, I just felt like it >.<</i>

*Fixed Dayblooms and Nightshades not showing the particles for diminishing returns.
*Fixed the Pure Daisy having the wrong icon in the lexicon index.
*Fixed the recipe for Metamorphic Stone Bricks outputting 1 rather than 4.

*Fixed the Mana Mirror trying to update on the server side, causing some desyncs sometimes. I think. I can't reproduce this issue so this is just a wild guess.

*Implemented regex based fake player checking. Not 100%, but should catch most of them.

r1.5 162
*<i>This line is here only to make the changelog look larger than it actually is. Did it work?</i>
*Fixed the Corporea Funnel not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the Ring of Magnetization not ignoring AE2 crystal seeds. <i>Fireball tricked me with the wrong IDs last time but this time I foiled his plans to foil my plans by getting them right, muahahaha! ...I'm tired.</i>
*Reordered some things in the mana part of the creative tab to make more sense. <i>I'm very perfectionist.</i>
r1.5 161
*Fixed server crash >.<
r1.5 160
*<i>Huh, 1.4 was shortlived.</i>
*<b>Added a new "Ender Artefacts" category to the Lexica Botania</b>, it contains new and old ender related things. Some entries from other categories have been moved over to this.
*<b>Added a Tutorial Mode</b> which guides you through the pages you should read, in order, to get a good understanding of the mod's basics.
*<b>Added Corporea, a new mechanic that allows for item verbal requesting.</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HcUMVJKoX8">Here</a>'s a video of it in action while it was still in development, it looks a bit cooler now.<i>This is by no means meant to be an AE replacement or competitor, just throwing it out there.</i>
*Added a Bottle of Ender Air, used as a crafting material and as means to create renewable End Stone.
*Added End Stone Bricks and Chiseled End Stone Bricks. <i>It's totally a good addition, stop judging me!</i>
*Added more alternate textures in the Unity texture pack style by Tobbvald to join those by Futureazoo, you can enable them in the config file.

*Fixed a crash with the Force Relay and Warp Lens.

r1.4 158

*Made the Rod of the Unstable Reservoir and Rod of the Shaded Mesa use Dreamwood Twigs in the crafting recipe.
*[API] Added setCollidedAt to IManaBurst

r1.4 156
*Fixed a crash when the Elementium Axe killed a player and dropped a skull.
*Fixed the game completely freezing on the mojang splash screen on some AMD graphics cards. Technical details can be found <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/commit/f8b0f2155d97944fcec7ab315864bb5f86ed9f54">here</a>.
*Fixed the Mana Enchanter adding enchantments twice to items that already have an NBT compound for some reason.

*The Soujourner's and Globetrotter's Sashes now actively try to change step height rather than on equip only.
*Thermalilies are now faster and make more mana per bucket of lava. However, after they go in a cooldown period after consuming a bucket. Also removed the obsidian config option as it's pretty useless anyway and made it non-elven knowledge again.
*(Technical) The lexicon's GUI now keeps the ItemStack used to open it to render the name, rather than pulling it from the current equipped stack.
r1.4 154
*<i>Holy moley, that's a long changelog. I apologize in advance if anything in this build is broken. I don't do "exclusive beta testing", and since this is a large version there'll probably be some kinks. I'll try my best to iron them out over the next couple of days!</i>
*Added 25 achievements, 20 are progression/side things and the other 4 are special challenges. <i>There's also one more achievement but we don't talk about that one.</i>
*Added 5 new flowers.<ul><li>Spectranthemum, functional, teleports items from around it to a defined point in the world. (Elven Knowledge)</li><li>Medumone, functional, freezes mobs in place.</li><li>Marimorphosis, functional, turns standard vanilla Stone into colored, decorative, stone variants depending on biome.</li><li>Narslimmus, generating, kills natural spawned slimes in slime chunks for mana, doesn't drop slimeballs or split them in two.</li><li>Spectrolus, generating, uses all 16 colors of wool sequentually to create mana.</li></ul>
*Added a "Complex Brews" page, with 6 new brews, 5 featuring new potion effects.<ul><li>Overload: A bunch of effects, Strength, Speed, Weakneess and Hunger.</li><li>Crossed Souls: Killing a mob gives the killer a bit of their HP.</li><li>Feather Feet: Fall damage immunity.</li><li>Vanity's Emptiness: Prevents mob spawns in a 128 block radius.</li><li>Crimson Shade: Removes mob spawn restrictions in a 64 block radius. (eg. Mobs can spawn in broad daylight, slimes in non-slime chunks, etc)</li><li>Marine Allure: Doubles the speed at which fishing rods work.</li></ul>
*Added a Gaia Spirit Ingot, used to summon a hard mode Gaia Guardian, it's harder, better, faster and stronger. It also drops moar lootz.
*Added Ancient Wills. Items that can crafted with a Terrasteel Helmet to provide for very powerful abilities. How do you get them? Who knows.
*Added armor set bonuses to sets of mana armor that apply when all 4 pieces are equipped.<ul><li>Manasteel: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools.</li><li>Elementium: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools, pixies apply random potion effects.</li><li>Terrasteel: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools, regeneration still works even when the food bar isn't topped off.</li></ul>
*Added Crafting Patterns, upgrades of sorts to the Crafty Crate which prevent items from going into slots. There's 9 basic ones that can be used for simple recipes: 1x1, 2x2, 1x2, 2x1, 1x3, 3x1, 2x3, 3x2 and Donut.
*Added Dreamwood Twigs, used to craft Elementium Tools instead of Livingwood Twigs.
*Added Mana Diamond and Dragonstone storage blocks.
*Added Overgrowth Seeds. A new dungeon loot item that allows you to enchant a piece of grass, making any flowers on it work at twice the speed.
*Added Sanity Checks to the lexicon GUIs to prevent crashing if one tries to open a page that doesn't exist. This is important for third party minetweaker support. (SoundLogic)
*Added Spellbinding Cloth. Combine it with an item to remove any enchants it has. <i>This one actually is a carbon copy of the one in Thaumic Tinkerer, this item is like a legacy in my mods. Surprised I hadn't stolen it from TT yet :V</i>
*Added the Lens Clip, an addon to the Mana Blaster that allows it to carry 6 lenses rather than just 1.

*Added the Rod of the Depths, a variant to the Rod of the Lands that places cobblestone.
*Added the Rod of the Molten Core. Almost a carbon copy of the Efreet's Flame Wand Focus from Thaumic Tinkerer. Look at a block and hold it to smelt it.
*Added the Thorn Chakram. A throwable weapon that bounces off blocks. <i>Yes, it's from terraria, shut up.</i>
*Added the World Seed. A new (stackable) item that can be used to instantly teleport to the world's spawn point case the user is at least 24 blocks away.
*Added Trodden Dirt Slabs.
*Baubles now detect the "first tick" using hash codes. This is a lot more reliable than using the old entity time method.

*Changed the Gaia Guardian's Landmine particles to look a bit better and not be as tricky to spot.
*Changed the Trodden Dirt recipe to use Sand instead of Gravel.
*Fixed a crash regarding dominant sparks when there's no other sparks available for transfer.
*Fixed dying Composite Lenses removing the composite component.<i>Took me long enough.</i>
*Fixed the Abstruse Platform recipe having stack size 0 for the components and causing divide by zero crashes with the NEI shift-[?] feature. <i>(Why does that even check the stack size? O.o)</i>
*Fixed the Assembly Halo consuming Blood Magic orbs and potentially other items whose container item is the item itself.
*Fixed the Life Imbuer spawning client-side only mobs.
*Fixed the Mana Enchanter and Mana Flash blocks appearing in the search creative tab.

*Fixed the Ring of Far Reach adding insane amounts of reach if one travels between dimensions.
*Fixed the Ring of Far Reach removing flight <i>(and breaking whatever arcane sorcery was behind the Angel Ring in Extra Utils)</i>.

*Made the Black Lotus rarely appear in Bonus Chests.
*Made the Fallen Kanade not work in the end to prevent cheesing the Ender Dragon.
*Mana Sparks now try to update the list of sparks they can transfer to after they're done ticking. Dominant Sparks will also attempt to pull mana from sparks at random rather than iteratively. When a Mana Pool with a Dominant Spark is charging an item and is full, instead of pulling from one Mana Pool exclusively it randomly pulls from all possible pools around.
*Mana Tablets now render on the player's belt, if there's one.
*Mana tools now have right click abilities. The Pickaxe places a torch from the inventory, the Axe does the same for a sapling and the Shovel works as a Hoe.
*Nerfed the Bands of Aura. A lot.
*Removed the health boost from Terrasteel Armor.
*Removed the item name remapper. It's completely useless at this point unless by some reason you're updating from a 10 month old build. It was also breaking downgrading as it was trying to remap items that didn't exist. 
*Removed the transparency in the HUD mana bars, as it looked absolutely god awful in higher resolutions/scales.
*The Elementium Pickaxe (and Elementium Tipped Terra Shatterer) will now look in the ore dictionary for what blocks not to break. Should help with Underground Biomes and other mods that add new stones.
*The Lexica Botania's in hand animation uses partial ticks now and isn't locked to 20fps any more. It looks so much smoother. <i>GLORIOUS 60FPS PC MASTER RACE</i>
*The Mana Prism can now be turned off with a redstone signal.
*The Tiny Potato can now be named in an anvil. It can also sing.
*Trodden Dirt now expands to a full block if there's a block above it.
*[API] Added IBurstViewerBauble for a bauble that acts as the Manaseer Monocle.
*[API] Added IManaDiscoutArmor. Pretty self explanatory.
*[API] Added methods to ManaItemHandler for handling mana discount for tools.
*[API] Added remove() to LexiconRecipeMappings. (SoundLogic)
*[API] Updated version number to 30.
r1.3 153

*Added the Black Lotus, a dungeon loot consumable that can be tossed onto a Mana Pool for a boost of mana.
*Added the Mana Prism, a new block that can change the properties of a Mana Burst on the fly.
*Added Trodden Dirt, a new block that looks great for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path">desire paths</a>. It also gives a slight speed boost. The texture and idea come from <a href="http://redd.it/2sqwu6">/u/LupusX's post on reddit</a>.
*Red String Spoofers will now also connect to mushrooms.
*Shifted the Assembly Halo HUD down 10px so it fits on smaller resolution/render scales.
*The Brewery and Enchanter now have the same progress pie as the Runic Altar.
*The Magnet Ring will no longer pull items that can contain mana, items that are on a terrasteel plate or AE2 crystal seeds.
*(Technical) IManaTrigger blocks with IManaCollisionGhost tile entities will still have their effect triggered. Furthermore IManaTrigger triggers for fake bursts too so that should be checked against.
*[API] Added IManaDissolvable and IDyablePool.
*[API] Increased version number to 29.
r1.3 151
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer.
r1.3 150
*Fixed a crash when using the crafting halo to make extra utils unstable ingots.
*Fixed more tpyos. <i>This is becoming a dank meme.</i>
*Fixed other mods' GUIs turning blue while the mana bar is being rendered. <i>They really should reset the glColor before rendering...</i>
*Fixed the Mana Fluxfield not sending energy to every RF receiver. (yueh)
*Fixed the Mana Fluxfield requiring the CoFH API to be present to work rather than the CoFH Energy API. (Vexatos)
*Fixed tools that break multiple blocks (manasteel shovel, terra shatterer) causing dupes with thermal expansion tanks and strongboxes and potentially other blocks that require exact harvest method call order.
r1.3 149
*Fixed Dominant Sparks being able to pull from blocks other than Mana Pools.
*Fixed Flashes dropping themselves.
*Moved the following flowers to elven knowledge: Thermalily, Kekimurus, Heisei Dream, Orechid, Loonium.
*Open Crates will now eject into the block below not only if it's an air block but also if it has no collision box. So yes, you can drop stuff on water now.
r1.3 148
*<i>I could have fit this on 147 but I only decided to do it later :V</i>
*Added support for <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445251-1-7-10-beta-wip-colored-light-progress-and">Colored Lights</a>. (<a href="http://puu.sh/dKo8o/7c34ca4d3d.png">Picture 1</a>) (<a href="http://puu.sh/dKozh/323db4f589.png">Picture 2</a>) You can find it in the following blocks:<ul><li>Glimmering Flowers</li><li>Floating Flowers (colored normal ones only)</li><li>Buried Petals</li><li>Sea Lanterns</li><li>Flashes</li></ul>
*Buried petals now emit a faint light.

r1.3 147
*<i>Just a small update to fix a major issue and a major annoyance.</i>
*Fixed a crash when placing a comparator next to a brewery.
*Fixed flowers sometimes rendering as floating due to the Y position shift in the render.
r1.3 146
*<i>Added some christmas spark. ARE YOU JINGLING YOUR BELLS YET?!</i>
*Fixed a major dupe with the Assembly Halo where right clicking a recipe would allow for more than one item to be crafted at once using only one set of resources.
*Fixed the render for the flowers not randomizing the position in the Z axis like vanilla flowers do. It still randomizes in the Y axis unlike vanilla flowers because I think it looks good.
*Sparks now properly check against how much space is left on the target block and don't try to put in more mana than available, actually making spark networks viable. <i>You can all point and laugh now.</i>
*The Assembly Halo is now more forceful with checking the validity of a recipe. It can no longer craft recipes purely from memory (and allowing as a way to craft things that have been changed since)
*The Mana Mirror now checks for the pool on update and has a backlog for calls inbetween. It also works cross dimension a lot better.
*[API] Added getAvailableSpaceForMana() to ISparkAttachable. This is very important and breaks backwards compatibility. If anyone is using that interface please adapt ASAP.
*[API] Increased version number to 28.
r1.3 145

*Botania Flowers now shift a bit depending on position similarly to vanilla flowers since 1.7. <i>About time.</i>

*Fixed the Halo on the Flugel wings rendering 1.62 blocks higher than normal on other players in multiplayer.
*Fixed the Rod of the Arcane Barrage crashing servers >_>
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer and Elementium Shovel having not working if the player's reach is above 4.5 (with the ring of far reach for example).
*Gave some more damage to the Rod of the Arcane Barrage.
*[API] Added IBaubleRender.
*[API] SubTileEntities now have an internal ticker.

*Fixed the Petal Apothecary consuming water bottles and added support for Forge IFluidContainerItem. (ganymedes01)
*Made the color for the floating island texture a bit more saturated. (Yulife)
*The shedding pages now properly use the world instance for creating entities. Should fix crashes with Fossils & Archeology. (SoundLogic)
r1.3 138
*"Added" a new item that works but is creative only for now, I'll work on it some more later >_>
*Added a proper, registered dependency on Baubles. <i>Only took over 100 versions to do it /o/</i>
*Fixed dreamwood not going to the right page when shift-right clicked with the lexicon.
*Fixed the color of Rainbow bursts and Gaia Spirits not changing in Mystcraft ages.

*The enchanter will now always properly reset the pylons' particle emitting status.
r1.3 137
*Fixed RedStringRenderer looking for the codechicken Vector3 rather than the botania one. On other words, Fixed the game crashing if you have a wand of the forest equipped while you have a red string block in the world and codechickencore isn't installed.
*Fixed the Red Stringed Spoofer not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer not actively restoring its damage like the manasteel tools do.
*Fixed the recipes for breaking back Reed and Thatch blocks giving items with metadata 1, and thus unusable.
r1.3 136
*<b>Added Red String and Red Stringed Blocks</b>. These can interact with other blocks remotely.
*Calling setWater on the petal apothecary now calls for a block update. <i>This is technical stuff for other modders only.</i>
*Changed some minor details in some lexicon entries so they are accurate to recent changes.
*Changed the brewery texture to a more appropriate one. (Yulife)
*Combining a Floating (any color) Flower with any botania flower with an effect (manastar, pure daisy, any generating or functional...) will replace the flower there with the one you put. The flower will still act like normally, but has the visual and technical properties of a Floating Flower.
*Fixed mod slabs letting light pass through.
*Fixed some tpyos in the elven lore page. <i>I desperately need someone to proofread the nonsense I write.</i>
*Fixed the game crashing if one tries to look up uses for the Tainted Blood Pendant in NEI.
*Fixed the runic altar not saving the amount of mana it should get (and thus causing the amount of mana it has to reset to 0 when it loads back).
*Fixed there being a missing texture on the terra plate, resulting in some unneeded log errors.
*Having Night Vision on a Tainted Blood Pendant will no longer make the brightness blink obnoxiously.
*Hopefully fixed entry sharing being somewhat fiddly in SMP.
*Removed the text that says that Bursts would work in the Terrasteel crafting, because it seems everyone gets confused and decides not to use sparks even though it clearly says it's the best way >.<

r1.3 135
*Added some more info to the Spark page.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate not taking the player to the Terrasteel entry when shift-right clicked with the lexicon.
*Removing sparks is now done via shift-right click, normal right click now shows which sparks it can connect to.
*The Gaia Guardian now spawns a few less mobs and spawns them in a smaller radius. It won't spawn pig zombies or spiders any more, but you might get witches.
*When a spark is placed in the world it displays what sparks it can connect to, this can be duplicated by right clicking it with a wand.
r1.3 134
*Fixed crash when looking at a mana pool if dark quartz is disabled in the config.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate taking mana from spreaders even if it isn't active.

r1.3 133

*<b>1.7.2 is no longer supported.</b>
*Added a Brew of Restoration, it's like the brew of Revitalization but it's Regeneration I for 2 minutes and uses redstone in the crafting.
*Added new lore/backstory pages for the events that separated the elves' world from the overworld. It's worth a read, but not required. Some text in the original entries was also changed to reflect.
*Added the Tainted Blood Pendant, it can store potions and give the player their effects while it's worn, for the cost of mana.
*Added the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate, which serves as the new method to create Terrasteel. You'd be wise to look at the Terrasteel page to check out how it works. It's pretty similar to the old method but allows for more control and can be done earlier in the game.
*Changed the Gaia Guardian fight a whole bunch, it's harder now to compensate for the new items and the fact that it can take damage from the Terra Blade now. Brews and a Terra Blade are a must now. The entry in the lexicon now describes the recommended gear. You can see what it does for yourself ;)

*Increased the max amount of mana a Terra Shatterer can hold up to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE">2147483647</a>. If you manage to reach this value you also get a fancy congratulatory message.
*Lexicon Entries containing documents from Elven Garde now have a special type of paper.
*The arena for the Gaia Guardian is now round, not square.

The default (and used by botania categories) is 5, entries like basics and misc use 9 and 0, respectively. Use setPriority() to set.

r1.2 127

*Mana Spreaders now unbind themselves from the wand when bound to something, no need to do it manually.
*Reorienting spreaders (and binding flowers now) has a beam effect as a visual confirmation.

r1.2 120

*The Shard of Laputa is now upgradable using aditional Gaia Spirits, each one increases the radius by 1 block, up to 20 can be used.
*The Soujourner's and Globetrotter's Sashes no longer work underwater, so you can't go at hyperspeed underwater. <i>Godspeed, Godspeed, Godspeed, speed us away</i>
*The Tangleberrie and Jyullia now ignore bosses. <i>soz.</i>
*Updating botania through the ingame downloader now has a link to my <a href="http://www.patreon.com/Vazkii">Patreon.</a> <i>Dollah dollah bills y'all.</i>

*[API] Added IExtendedPlayerController.
*[API] Exposed IPixieSpawner from internal classes.
*[API] Increased version number to 7.
r1.1 96
*Fixed crashes when an invalid PlayerInteractEvent is fired (mostly because Cauldron throws them around like they're free samples).
r1.1 95
*Added "dammit reddit".
*Added a config option to disable the Mana Enchanter.
*Added the Crimson Pendant, a "tier 2" Pyroclast Pendant that does what the old one used to pre-nerf.
*Added the Hand of Ender, an item that allows not only for access of one's ender chest, but of others' via right clicking on them. (the last feature can be toggled in the config).
*Added The Spectator, a new bauble that lets you search for items in inventories, dropped around, in players/horses' inventories, equipped by mobs and that villagers trade.
*Changed the recipe for the Pyroclast Pendant to make more sense with the recent nerf.
*The Pixies the Gaia Guardian spawns no longer take non-player damage, so you can't cheese the battle with Tiny Planet + Terra Blade. <i>Sorry Lewis :3</i>
r1.1 94
*Added Mob Spawners to the Botania creative tab. Using a spawn egg on them changes the mob it's spawning, similar to MC:PE.
*Added the Ender Overseer, a new block that detects when players are looking at it and gives out a redstone signal.
*Nerfed the Pyroclast Pendant, now it only protects the wearer from fire damage if they are not standing on fire or lava.
r1.1 93
*Actually fix the skull renderer because I'm an undereducated idiot who has no clue what they're doing or how the java compiler works :V
r1.1 92
*Doubled the range in which the Mana Enchanter can pull from Mana Pools. The range it was before was stupidly low anyway.
*Fixed Azulejo blocks pointing to the wrong lexicon entry.
*The new skull renderer only registers on 1.7.10 since they changed the skin system and I can't compile for both functions.
*[API] Added oreZinc to the list of ores the Orechid can spawn.
*[API] Increased version number to 6.
r1.1 91
*Added new building blocks: Reed Block, Thatch, Netherrack Bricks, Soul Bricks, Snow Bricks, <a href="http://www.madeireirafalsarella.com.br/arquivos/produtos/telhas/portuguesa/01-g.jpg">Roof Tiles</a> (all with stair and slab variants) and 12 types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo">Azulejos</a> for use with white Quartz.
*Hopperhocks will no longer pick items up right after a mana pool crafts them.
*I was playing with TC and realized I wanted Botania armor mixed in with the Goggles of Revealing, so you can do that now.
*Lowered the chance for the Lexica Botania to spawn in the Bonus Chest, according to almighty reddit it was too high.
*Player heads now render with the hat/hair layer as they do in the normal model, so your crafted heads won't look weird now. Thanks to Kihira for this!
*Removed the Baubles Button from the inventory as that feature is provided by Baubles itself now.
r1.1 90
*Added a new generating flower, the Gourmaryllis, it eats food to make mana, but there's a catch...
*Added a new recipe for Mana Alchemy, Coarse Dirt (just vanilla dirt with metadata value 1, grass can't spread to it, the stuff that spawns in the Mega Taiga).
*Added Rainbows for Nemsun.
*Added the Crafty Crate (and a Placeholder item for use with it), a counterpart to the Open Crate that can autocraft items.
*Fixed a crash when binding the Wand of the Forest to a spreader and right clicking on something with no collision box (tall grass, flowers, etc).
*Fixed chat spam when using a Wand of the Forest or spawning pixies.
*Fixed the Kindle Lens destroying blocks.
*Fixed the Wand of the Forest trying to interact with objects on the client when it's bound to a spreader. So when bound to a spreader, mana pools will no longer change their mode in the client but update when clicked normally.
*Lowered default flower quantity and density to 2 and 16 respectively (was 3 and 32).
*Lowered default villager shed avg interval from 82000 to 226000 (this won't affect old configs).
*The Hopperhock is now more efficient at picking up items and picks up any it can find instead of just one at a time, this makes automating systems that require timing a lot easier.
*The Hopperhock now respects inventory max stack sizes.
*The Mana Enchanter is more expensive and puts less empahsis in the rarity of the enchantment.
*The Mana Pool no longer has a cooldown between being able to craft items but rather a timer on when it can "re-craft" an item after it crafted it (see wood log transmutation for example).
*The Mana Pool will no longer emit charging/discharging FX if no transfer happened (when either the pool or the item is full/empty).
*The Snowflake Pendant no longer creates ghost ice blocks in the client and is now properly centered on the player.
*Toned down the mana pool charging/discharging fx for sake of performance.
*[API] Added ILaputaImmobile for blocks that shouldn't be able to be moved by the Shard of Laputa. For Victorious3 for BetterStorage crates.

r1.1 89

*Added some Illustrations to the Daybloom and Hydroangeas entries to explain better how they work.
*Added the Life Imbuer, a means of allowing spawners to work without players nearby.
*If a Wand of the Forest is bound to a spreader, it'll always show that spreader's bounding box instead of any other, to make it more obvious.
*Spreaders now aim to the center of blocks taking their collision box in mind and not a 1x1x1 box.

*Added the Rod of the Highlands, an upgrade to the Rod of the Lands that lets you place blocks in midair.
*Changed some documentation.<ul><li>The Runic Altar's entry now has a small preface telling players they should look into Mana Manipulation first.</li><li>The Mana Spreader's entry now has clearer instructions for how the rotating is done and documentation for the fact that you can disable it with a redstone signal.</li><li>The disclaimer that lenses only function when there's a proper block to shoot at has been changed and moved to a single page rather than being on various lenses' pages.</li></ul>
*Fixed Mana Burst particles going above the spreader on the first few ticks.
*Fixed shaders not compiling sometimes and causing crashes/log spam. <i>I have no idea what I'm doing :V</i>

r1.1 87
*Fixed Mana Spreaders freezing your game, woot!
*Removed the ability for the Rod of the Seas to place water in the nether, after some thought it wasn't that great of an idea after all.

r1.1 85
*<b>Botania should now work properly in a developer environment</b> and not complain about sand in it's eyes or something.

*Added the Infrangible Platform, a counterpart to the Abstruse and Spectral Platforms only available in creative, its' collision box is similar to a regular block and it's unbreakable, it's meant for mapmakers, see.
*Added the Ring of Far Reach (Elven Knowledge), it increases your reach by 3 blocks.
*Changed the Terra Shatterer texture to Futureazoo's. See previous link.
*Fixed the Drum of the Gathering dropping the Drum of the Wild instead.
*Fixed the Mana Lens crafting recipe only allowing you to use invalid combinations instead of valid ones.
*Fixed the Shard of Laputa...<ul><li>Being allowed to go above world height.</li><li>Sometimes having an offset of 1 block.</li><li>Being able to be used in the nether</li><li>Being able to mobilize Bedrock and other unbreakable blocks.<li>Overriding any blocks already in the area.</li><li>Stopping if the player relogs.</li><li>Creating bursts that can be pulled by the Tiny Planet <i>(lol)</i>.</li></ul>
*Fixed the Tiny Planet creating way too many particles when used with the Terra Blade.
*Mana Bursts now properly save the time they've been in the world and the lens they were spawned with when you leave the game.

*[API] Added ITinyPlanetExempt.
*[API] Incremented Version number to 4.
r1.1 84

*Fixed Elementium Armor having a 100% chance to spawn pixies.
*Items that come out of the Elven Portal get asigned an NBT tag to prevent them from going back in, in case some other mod adds recipes (like Modtweaker).
*Lowered the amount of Gaia Spirits the Gaia Guardian drops (from 12 to 8).
*Renamed "Mystical Instruments" to "Mystical Items", because it makes more sense and is less confusing.
*The Petal Apothecary now has a smarter checking for what it considers seeds. Read: Natura Hop<i>seed</i> wood won't work now :p
*Tweaked the Mana Burst particles, now they never leave any empty space between them, so you get a proper straight burst when you fire it with a mana blaster instead of a bunch of loose particles. The color and size also randomizes a bit to make each burst distint, even if just by a bit.
r1.1 83
*Changed the Lexicon HUD icon to be a lot less intrusive.
*Fixed Gaia Pylons' in-world lexicon click going to the wrong entry.
*Shaders now use GLSL version 120 instead of whatever they feel like. Should fix issues with some GPUs having lag with them enabled. If your GPU doesn't support GLSL version 120 you should consider upgrading (or turning shaders off in the config I guess).
*The Charm of the Diva is now a lot more reliable.
r1.1 82
*Added a config option to disable the animation when an item is charging on a mana pool.
*Added some Botania loot to the Bonus Chest, Stronghold and Dungeon chests.

*The Gaia Guardian now blocks flight.
r1.1 81
*Fixed a crash when breaking a mana pool, since the fix for the crash when placing a mana spreader broke that. >_>

r1.1 76

*Fixed Bifrost blocks being pickupable in creative.
*Fixed some seeds not getting picked up by the petal apothecary (any registered with "Seed" in the name rather than "seed" because the check was case sensitive). (ganymedes01)
*The burst from a Damaging Lens or Terra Blade now has a larger collision box and hits mobs in a small radius around it.
*The Flugel Tiara is now made with Elementium.
*The Mana Usage display for Mana Infusion and Runic Crafting recipes in the Lexica Botania now shows that it's on a 10:1 ratio. Hovering over the bar changes it to 1:1 ratio.

r1.1 75

*Increased the range in which the terrasteel crafting process can pull mana from.

*Fixed the block breaking particles of the creative mana pool being of the Livingrock Bricks.
*Having a Mana Void or any Catalyst below the Mana Pool changes it's texture.

*The Mana Blaster now has a subtle flicker effect on it's texture.
*The Mana Detector now emits some red particles while it's emiting a redstone signal.

r1.1 70
*<b>Massively optimized the particle render code.</b> Botania particles will no longer kill your fps. In doing this they also render properly over water now, so that's neat. <i>Yo Azanor, you should do this too for nitor.</i>
*Added <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/484136285251309568">Matrix Mode</a> as a config option. This was a visual glitch I got while changing the particle code that I decided to leave in because it was funny.
r1.1 69
*Added a new lens (that requires elven knowledge), the Paintslinger Lens.
*Changed the Pixie Dust texture to be pink to match the other elven resources and the pixie mob texture. <i>You were waiting for it, confess.</i>

r1.1 63
*Fixed generating flowers in the corners of chunks (and in general) causing lots of unnecessary chunk updates.
*Fixed lack of canUpdate() override on TileManaVoid, in theory this shouldn't impact performance unless you somehow had hundreds of them, but it fixes MCPC+ complaining. <i>/shrug.</i>

*Fixed Mana Spreaders not showing the prediction beam, another thing broken by 54...
r1.0 55
*Added some sanity checking to the flowers' connection code to reflect the changes in 54, be it for Spreaders or Pools. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog. I can't exactly tell you if that is the case though, because this issue is completely sporadic and nigh-on impossible to reproduce with consistency. <i><b>Warning</b>: This change modifies API files SubTileGenerating.java and SubTileFunctional.java. Third time's the charm, right? Please be so.</i>
*Mana Mirrors no longer show their binding in the tooltip, but rather in world.
*[API] Added ICoordBoundItem.
r1.0 54
*Added some checks to the adding of mana spreaders and mana pools to the world. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog.

*Added some new items that don't do anything yet, don't mind them, I just happened to have them done before I pushed this update.
r1.0 53
*Fixed compatibility with the latest forge versions with ore dictionary changes. <b>The mod now requires forge 1117 at minimum</b>.
r1.0 52

r1.0 51

*Added some sanity checking to the flowers' connection code, be it for Spreaders or Pools. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog.

*Renaming the Lexica Botania changes it's cover and title.

r1.0 48
*Fixed Generating Flowers never outputting any mana whatsoever to spreaders.
*<i>*sigh*</i>
