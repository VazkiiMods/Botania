<b>Garden of Glass</b> is a botania addon. Having installed will allow you to create a <b>skyblock</b> type world.<br>
Aside from allowing you to have a skyblock world, a few items and blocks are added, as well as some recipes in botania tweaked to fit the skyblock.<br>
The goal of this addon is to allow for every single item in the game to be acquired properly in a skyblock evironment.<br>
The jar file required to play this mode is a mod, but contains no code and behaves similarly to a glorified datapack.<br>
It contains the recipe changes to the base game, and signals to the base Botania mod to enable other GoG features.<br>
