{% include changelog_header.html version="Upcoming" %}

* Add: Horn and Drum of the Wild can break moss carpet, with the option to add more blocks through a block tag
* Add: Bergamute occludes vibrations within its range
* Add: Holding a Floral Obedience Stick while placing a special flower prevents it from automatically binding to a spreader or pool, and using the stick on a special flower unbinds it from its spreader or pool
* Add: Big dripleaf plants can be shrunk back to their small form using mana infusion with an alchemy catalyst
* Add: Tectonic Girdle also nullifies explosion knockback
* Change: Cellular blocks around the boundary of a Dandelifeon's simulation area are ignored, unless they belong to another active Dandelifeon (NEstoll)
* Change: Charm of the Diva also supports charming or targeting neutral mobs that are angry at the player or attacking one of the player's tamed animals, and properly prevents the player's tamed animals from being affected or targeted by the charm
* Change: Dandelifeon recipe also requires a redstone root (zacharybarbanell)
* Change: Terrasteel tool speed and damage was updated to match corresponding netherite values
* Change: Bumped up the amount of mana contained in bursts from Manastorm Charges; this doesn't change their behavior, but maybe you can find a new use for them in less destructive ways
* Change: Various crafting recipes moved to more fitting categories in the vanilla recipe book
* Change: Several book entries were updated, including various recipe presentations:
  * Petal Apothecary and Runic Altar recipes show the reagent, similar to how they do in recipe viewer mods already
  * Multi-crafting page templates are now used more widely where it makes sense, like when alternative items in recipes need to be implemented as individual recipes (e.g. the mana pearl and mana diamond variants of the runic altar and mana tablet recipes)
  * Missing lookup references for derivatives of certain decorative blocks (e.g. quartz variants) have been added for the quick-lookup feature while holding the book
  * Lexica Botania acknowledges that Trinkets are used on Fabric instead of Curios
  * Various entries were updated to match recent changes and fix old errors
* Change: The Ring of Loki now has a (reasonably high) selection limit to prevent players from accidentally "NBT-banning" themselves from their world or server by going too hard with it
* Remove: Config option `orechidPriorityMods` didn't have any effect since 1.16, never made it to Fabric, and is now gone in the Forge version as well; pack authors should use data pack recipes to define Orechid outputs and weights
* Fix: Flight bar for Flügel Tiara no longer overlaps with the refilling air bubbles indicator or the mount health bar, if that uses more than one row
* Fix: The Manaseer Monocle's flower radius indicator no longer jumps around if you are very far from the world origin, and should also not Z-fight with the binding radius indicator of luminizers anymore
* Fix: The air bubble created by Bubbells no longer flickers with inflowing water
* Fix: Charm of the Diva works on Forge again
* Fix: Translation key names for potted glimmering flowers were wrong in the English language file
* Fix: Corporea Index on Fabric no longer ignores chat text sources other than the vanilla chat console, fixing compatibility with e.g. the "Microphone Text Input" mod
* Fix: Pollidisiac gives animals their deserved break after breading again
* Fix: Shard of Laputa no longer breaks *all* the 2-tall grass/flower blocks anymore
* Fix: Floating flower islands properly show the soil type on Forge, and are no longer invisible in Patchouli multiblock visualizations (although that latter part is merely a workaround for a Patchouli issue at the moment)
* Fix: Position of the binding information icon on flowers' wand HUD has been adjusted to not overlap with longer flower names
* Fix: Suspicious stew effect from Pure Daisy actually works now, clearing all active status effects
* Fix: Potential integer overflow in Ring of Loki mana calculation

---

    main hand to be empty
* Change: Players that have the "Blessing" advancement can now see the event repeatedly
* Change: Bore-warp lenses now spawn the drops behind the spreader's facing, instead of
  inside the spreader (artemisSystem)
* Change: Retexture the mystical flowers (falkory220)
* Change: Petal Apothecary now only renders center 10x10 square of the liquid texture,
  instead of rendering the entire 16x16 texture and squashing it into a 10x10 space
* Change: Vine ball tweaks (artemisSystem)
  * If a vine ball entity can't place any vines where it hits, it drops itself
  * Vine balls now only place up to a maximum of 9 vines per hit
  * Hitting a Solid Vine with a vine ball will extend the current chain of vines downward
    (by up to 9 blocks)

  * Retexture and remodel all existing blocks
  * Adjust the Petal Apothecary's hitbox to fit its new model
  * Rename all the families:
    Forest -> Fuchsite, Plains -> Talc, Mountain -> Gneiss, Fungal -> Mycelite,
	Swamp -> Cataclasite, Desert -> Solite, Taiga -> Lunite, Mesa -> Rosy Talc
  * Changed the biomes each family spawns in, check Lexicon for details
  * Add walls for each family
  * Mushrooms can now grow on Mycelite
* Change: NBT matching tweaks (artemisSystem)
  * Corporea requests now match exact NBT, instead of doing a "fuzzy match" that could
    grab items with extra NBT
  * This also means items with no tags will only match other items with no tags
  * Extended the hopperhock's special casing of mana items to corporea requests as well.
    Also made it not ignore other NBT data on the mana items.
  * Removed the 10-mana "fuzz" when determining mana item fullness.
  * All mana items are changed to never store a `Mana:0` tag, having a missing `Mana`
    entry represent the no mana state, to have more consistent behavior with other
	mods that compare NBT.
  * Fix ItemNBTHelper's `removeEntry` method. Previously it would leave behind an empty
    compound tag instead of removing it entirely, causing unexpected behavior
	(it now just calls the vanilla method, which handles this properly)
* API: Petal Apothecary is now a LiquidBlockContainer, meaning it can be filled by
  other mods that look for that interface (such as Hex)
* API: Make the entity using the horn available in IHornHarvestable

* Welcome to Botania on 1.16.1, brought to you by williewillus and Hubry
* Special thanks to the patrons and players on the patron server for helping test
* Note: 1.16.2 is coming soon and we know it to have some minor breakage. This version may not be directly usable in 1.16.2, but worlds should be upgradable to it perfectly.

* Added the Ring of Dexterous Motion, a new bauble that allows you to dodge to the sides using the A and D keys.
* Attempting to summon a Gaia Guardian with an invalid arena now emits particles on the offending blocks.
* Buffed the gaia guardian's wither effect due to it being easier to dodge now.

* Removed Needless Fluff: Roof Tiles, Hellish, Soul, and Frost Bricks, Trodden Dirt, Unstable Blocks, and Signal Flares.
* Removed Primus Loci.
* Removed the passive decay config again.
* Removed the prismarine alchemy recipe.
* Removed the Pylons and Mana Pools from the Elven Portal multiblock. They can now be placed anywhere in an 11x11 area. You can also have more than 2 Pylons, if you desire.
* Removed Timless Ivy (needless because of the existance of Mending in vanilla).
* Replaced a lot of cringy memes and terribly placed references with some less cringy memes and terribly placed references.
* The Elven Portal now takes mana per transaction rather than per tick. It will also no longer close itself if there's no mana.
* The Gaia Guardian's attacks now display as an overlay in the world rather than as particles only.
* The Livingwood Avatar can now place down dirt using the Rod of the Lands.
* The Rosa Arcana can now get its XP from orbs in the world.
* The Tiny Potato can now have items given to it. Many of the "easter egg" names for it have been removed as you can replicate them with this feature.
* Updated Corporea textures and some those of some of the livingrock blocks.
* Updated the dispenser planting's entry and feature set. It now duplicates Quark's dispenser planting so it can plant Cocoa Beans as well. Quark's disabels itself if Botania is present.
* [API] Removed a bunch of stuff that is no longer used.
* [API] Added a getFacing() method to IAvatarTile, this is used for the Rod of the Lands.
* [API] Increased version number to 80.
* **This version is for Minecraft 1.10.2, and carries on from the latest release of <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/botania-unofficial">Botania Unofficial</a>.**
* **A massive thanks is due to <a href="https://twitter.com/williewillus">williewillus</a>, who took it upon himself to port and maintain the mod all the way through 1.8, 1.9 and to 1.10. Please go send him love and hugs, as us being here would not be possible without him.**
* **If you want to know what changed in between, have a look through the Releases page on <a href="https://github.com/williewillus/Botania/releases">williewillus/Botania.</a>**
* **This is the first release for 1.10.2, which sets up for further content expansion, while removing obsolete and bloated pieces of content. More content is planned and will be coming soon.**
* **You can mitigate your worlds from Botania Unofficial to Botania just fine, any of the removed pieces of content you had in your world will just disappear.**
* **A few pieces of content from Botania's 1.7.10 releases was removed in Botania Unofficial due to them being added to <a href="http://quark.vazkii.net/">Quark</a>, another mod by me which I highly recommend you install alongside Botania.**
* **If you were looking for BotaniaV2, most of that project was scrapped in favour of this update instead. I decided that instead of reinventing a mod that's already good, I'd use the concepts there to make a new mod instead, which I am planning, but want to get some new stuff onto Botania and Quark before I move onto that.**
* **And that's it for my important note. I'm back to Botania, and I hope you carry on enjoying it.**

## Botania Unofficial Era
During this era of Botania's life, the mod was ported externally by williewillus
(who was not yet a member of the team at the time), through Minecraft versions
1.8 up to 1.10.2, encompassing all versions after 249 up to and including 321.
This section of the page is an archive of the changelogs of those versions of Botania
Unofficial for posterity. Hope you enjoy the history!

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 321" %}

Changes:
* Code/asset cleanups

Fix:
* Fix avatar and cocoon being invisible in inventory
* Fix bergamute making custom sound classes infinite loop (RFTools, Dynamic Surroundings)

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 320" %}

This is getting ridiculous ><

Fixes:
* Crash when putting petal in petal apothecary
* Stars not showing in GoG skybox

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 319" %}

Important: If you use Natural Pledge, be sure to update to Natural Pledge 1.5 or above!

Hotfix on the hotfix, ugh. See build 318/317 for full changelog.

Fix:
* Fix crash due to particels spawning serverside
* Fix Botania's banner patterns not showing up on shields (LGcommisar)
* Floral powder is now registered to oredict name "dye" (pau101)

Enjoy

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 318" %}

Once again, use the next build :/

Important: If you use Natural Pledge, be sure to update to Natural Pledge 1.5 or above!

Hotfix. See previous build 317 for full release notes.

Fix:
* Gaia Guardian crashing with ConcurrentModificationException

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 317" %}

Use next build pls

Important: If you use Natural Pledge, be sure to update to Natural Pledge 1.5 or above!

Small build, but school is starting tomorrow so I want to get this out before a drop in activity.

Java 8, Baubles, Forge 2053+, JEI 3.7.8

Changes:
* zh_CN lang updates (3TUSK)
* Lexicon picture for crafty crate shows updated Crafting Placeholder texture (Luxor5393)
* Internal cleanups
* Optimized floating flower model, it should render faster now when animated, I will continue to explore options to optimize the animated ones
* Also added a config option to render floating flowers statically. This means they don't animate but render not just faster but A LOT faster. This option makes them render as fast as normal blocks like fences.

Fixes:
* Fixed Bergamute having flower particle colour not matching what the flower looks like (this doesn't affect the particles it makes when it absorbs a sound)
* Fixed Bergamute not working on ticking sounds like minecarts
* Fix orechid running clientside and being weird
* Fix pixies despawning immediately clientside, meaning they were invisible and couldn't be attacked
* Fix pixies flying too slowly towards their targets
* Fix banner back-textures not being reversed like they should be

Enjoy!

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 316" %}

* Magic flower recipes now show properly in JEI
* Mana blaster now shows the active lens on the barrel
* Corporea no longer runs clientside
* Mana Enchanter is now more lax about what can go on an item:
  Before, used Enchanting Table rules to determine if item can be enchanted, now uses anvil rules
  Lets you apply unbreaking to shields, etc.
* Remove vineball + cobble -> moss stone recipe (there's a cheaper vanilla one)
* Remove old tooltips from Coarse Dirt and Mob Spawner

Fixes:
* All special tiny potatoes should now render properly

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 315" %}

Small build but again I need some fires to get put out

Java 8, JEI 3.7.8, Forge 2044+

IMPORTANT

* Fix blocks disappearing, transforming, or becoming missing models on chunk reload
* Forge fixed a pretty serious vanilla bug in the blockstate ID map in 2027, that a lot of mods were unintentionally relying upon. However, that fix was incomplete and was not completely resolved until 2044. If you are running the mod in a version in this range of buggy Forges from 2027-2044 (I'm looking at you Unstable >.>) be aware that I've had users report blocks disappearing or transforming when upgrading out of that range. You've been warned, and I'm very sorry for the bugs.

Changes:

* More json and model registration cleanup
* Lexicon 3D model is back! Looks a bit wonky in the left hand but works good enough
* Removed option to "disable 1.8 stones" (they were removed). The mana infusion recipes for the vanilla versions are now always-on
* Black Hole Talisman uses capabilities to deposit things.
* Version checker now just piggybacks off the Forge version checker
* Small performance boost to the very laggy floating flower rendering. A more effective solution is being worked on

Fixes:

* Fix said 1.8 stone mana infusion recipes acting weird in the presence of the Ore Dict

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 314" %}

Small build, but necessary to put out some fires.

For 1.10.2 only!

Built on Java 8, Forge 2041 (anything above 2018 should work), JEI 3.7.8

Changes:

* Made a bunch of eventhandlers static. That probably means nothing to most of you, other than things will run negligibly faster :P
* The day is here: All blocks duplicated from vanilla/Quark have been removed. The nag is gone as well - you're welcome ;). PLEASE ensure you have heeded the nag if you've built with these blocks as they'll disappear!
* Added ManaDiscountEvent (Flaxbeard)
* Mana Enchanter costs more to apply treasure enchantments.
* Remove some log spam from Mana Enchanter.

Fixes:

* Fix blocks turning into other blocks when being placed (Forge fixed a vanilla bug I was unintentionally relying on)
* Fix cacophonium not working at all
* Fix slingshot not working properly
* Fix walls being flipped around in inventory
* model cleanups ongoing

Welcome to Botania unofficial 1.8! This is my unofficial port and continuation of Vazkii's wonderful mod Botania.
This will serve as our "release candidate" for the real 1.8 release. I've incremented the build number by 50. This is if there are any more patches to 1.7.10, they won't run into our numbers.

Note: In the time before build 299 was released, I used a bespoke decimal
version-numbering scheme that didn't match with the Botania numbering style. Here I've
just called them `r1.8 298-<0.0.xxx>` to fit in the changelog.

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 298-0.6.4.2" %}

Hotfix on the hotfix

Changes:
- Retrofit corporea to work with forge capabilities
- Corporea will query for "TOP" side capability first and fall back on null side.
- Fix spark icon not being colored based on which network it's on
- Added a reference to our favourite magician

Note: Some semi-major code shuffling is going on internally, especially pertaining to interaction with inventories. Please report any bugs you find, and thanks for helping out!

Enjoy!

Don't use this release, corporea is broken. Please wait for the next (0.6.4.2). Sorry for the inconvenience!

Your next weekly build

- Fix pools and other te's suddenly getting wiped clientside when lots of blocks change (e.g. when a tree grows)

- Fix pools looking weird when held in third person

New build! 

Based on latest recommended Forge for Minecraft 1.8.9, Botania 1.7 b248, Java 8, Baubles 1.1.3.0

Changes:

- Futureazoo's alternate flower textures have been split out into a resource pack here: https://github.com/williewillus/Botania/tree/MC18/alt_resources. Unfortunately, the way rendering has changed it's too complicated to switch the textures out using a config option. Sorry!

New build with some various bugfixes

Built on Java 8, MinecraftForge 1722 (latest stable 1.8.9, REQUIRED), Baubles 1.1.2.0, Botania 1.7.10 b248

Changes:
- Minor code cleanups
- Optimize incense plate and red string TESRs
- Fix pylons not showing their fancy particles
- Minor optimization to hourglass
- Fix rod of the seas crashing
- Fix water bowl being unobtainable
- Fix hovering over unbound functional flowers crashing
- Fix pick block on tall mystical flowers
- MAJOR: Corporea Funnel change to accomodate 1.8 item frames
  - Item frames in 1.7 had four possible states, up right down and left. This corresponded with the funnel pulling 1, 16, 32, and 64 items. Going above four rotations crashes in previous 1.8 builds
  - In 1.8, the intermediate directions are also available, so the funnel's item frame filters have changed to accommodate this. In clock wise order, the items pulled by the funnel are now ~~**1**, 16, **24**, 32, **40**, 48, **56**, and 64.~~ These values will be changed the next release, don't get comfortable with them

Known issues:
- Some apothecaries missing texture, spreaders missing texture
- Pump missing texture right now, I'm working on migrating it to JSON, which is what you see ;)

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.8 298-0.5.2.2" %}

_sighs_

Changes:

The stupid receiveMana crash should no longer happen ever, but only because I've suppressed the symptoms, not the cause. <b>I need your help</b>:

Where it would've crashed in past builds, I've now put an obnoxious message saying "CLIENT TICK FAILED". If you see this, PLEASE REPORT it to this thread: https://github.com/williewillus/Botania/issues/71. Please include if you are on SP or MP, and what kind of machine (as in what kind of in game contraption) it errored on. If you notice a recurring pattern in what coordinates this occurs at, a certain type of flower, etc. please include that as well

Thank you so much for helping me hunt this down!

Enjoy

* Added 3 new lenses:
  *   Mana Lens: Redirectory - Bursts that have this lens fired from a spreader will, when colliding with another spreader, rotate the collided spreader to point towards the one that shot. It also gives bursts the Phantom effect.

([demo 1](https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/666012115900190720), [demo 2](https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/666013977089060864))

  *   Rod of the Hells: Creates a perpetual fire ring around it, like the rod does.
  *   Rod of the Plentiful Mantle: Minims the rod's effect of showing nearby ores, the colors stay the same as long as it stays in the same place.

I might end up removing it alltogether.*
* Changed the Gaia Guardian's health to 800 (from 300) and the damage cap to 35 (from 12), 50 if it's a crit. In a way, if you're properly prepared, the boss is actually easier now as it's definitely possible to hit that hard with the proper enchants and potions, it just requires preparation.

* [API] Increased version number to 64.

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.7 223" %}

* Added code to safely crash the game if someone overrides the Botania API's Internal Method Handler. Overriding the Internal Method Handler is a sure fire way to crash the game or cause incompatibility problems later down the line, so at least you're getting informed about it with a proper error message. It's sad that I even had to makXe this, to be honest.
* Fixed a circular dependency chain with DragonAPI not allowing for the game to load.
* Fixed Red Stringed Conparators only seeing half of a double chest.

* The Mana Pool's "water" icon is now a different icon and not the one used for water. (it still looks the same, it's just in a different file)

* *This line is here only to make the changelog look larger than it actually is. Did it work?*
* Fixed the Corporea Funnel not being in the creative tab.

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.5 160" %}

* *Huh, 1.4 was shortlived.*
* **Added a new "Ender Artefacts" category to the Lexica Botania**, it contains new and old ender related things. Some entries from other categories have been moved over to this.
* **Added a Tutorial Mode** which guides you through the pages you should read, in order, to get a good understanding of the mod's basics.
* **Added Corporea, a new mechanic that allows for item verbal requesting.** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HcUMVJKoX8">Here</a>'s a video of it in action while it was still in development, it looks a bit cooler now.*This is by no means meant to be an AE replacement or competitor, just throwing it out there.*
* Added a Bottle of Ender Air, used as a crafting material and as means to create renewable End Stone.
* Added End Stone Bricks and Chiseled End Stone Bricks. *It's totally a good addition, stop judging me!*
* Added more alternate textures in the Unity texture pack style by Tobbvald to join those by Futureazoo, you can enable them in the config file.
* Added some disclaimers to the lexicon that shears made of mana materials will trigger tripwire and that blood magic messes with the fallen kanade (if BM is loaded).
* Changed some recipes to use a Bottle of Ender Air.
* Changed the creative tab so all the fluff (decorative blocks and the like) is right at the end rather than in the middle.

* Fixed a crash with the Force Relay and Warp Lens.
* Fixed particles being able to spawn in the client world and chunkloading somehow.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.4 158" %}

* Added a new Mana Lens: Warp. It teleports bursts around. It lets you make quarries (good luck with that).
* Fixed potions IDs being set to a value over 127 by default and added a check to change the old configs to a new proper value, networking passes the values as a byte, which means anything over 127 got messed up and crashed the game.

* Made the Rod of the Unstable Reservoir and Rod of the Shaded Mesa use Dreamwood Twigs in the crafting recipe.
* [API] Added setCollidedAt to IManaBurst
* [API] Updated version number to 31

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.4 157" %}

* Added a sanity check in the case that a brew is null for some reason, previously it would crash the nei lookup.
* Changed the film grain shader again to fix AMD cards not working, again. I don't have an AMD card to test so fingers crossed it works this time.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.4 156" %}

* Fixed a crash when the Elementium Axe killed a player and dropped a skull.
* Fixed the game completely freezing on the mojang splash screen on some AMD graphics cards. Technical details can be found <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/commit/f8b0f2155d97944fcec7ab315864bb5f86ed9f54">here</a>.
* Fixed the Mana Enchanter adding enchantments twice to items that already have an NBT compound for some reason.
* Fixed the Trodden Dirt Slabs giving the wrong block when picked in creative.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.4 155" %}

* Added a proper config for potion IDs rather than letting them auto-assign.
* Changed the Ring of Chordata to check for air levels a bit better so it works properly with Mariculture.
* Fixed Ancient Wills working without the full armor set.
* Fixed Black Lotuses spawning on jungle temple dispensers rather than chests.
* Fixed Mobs' AI getting stuck in the terrasteel plate.

* Moved the Crafting Table HUD icon on the Assembly Halo down a bit so it doesn't render behind the text.
* Moved the Greater Band of Aura's output back a bit, it's not as strong as it used to be, but it's a bit better than last update.
* Removed the text that states Terrasteel Armor has HP boost as that was removed last version.
* The Gaia Guardian now has slighty better fake player checker code and can no longer be killed by TT dynamism tablets. Sorry!
* The Greater Bands of Aura and Mana are now crafted both with a single Terrasteel Ingot rather than two.
* The Soujourner's and Globetrotter's Sashes now actively try to change step height rather than on equip only.
* Thermalilies are now faster and make more mana per bucket of lava. However, after they go in a cooldown period after consuming a bucket. Also removed the obsidian config option as it's pretty useless anyway and made it non-elven knowledge again.
* (Technical) The lexicon's GUI now keeps the ItemStack used to open it to render the name, rather than pulling it from the current equipped stack.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.4 154" %}

* *Holy moley, that's a long changelog. I apologize in advance if anything in this build is broken. I don't do "exclusive beta testing", and since this is a large version there'll probably be some kinks. I'll try my best to iron them out over the next couple of days!*
* Added 25 achievements, 20 are progression/side things and the other 4 are special challenges. *There's also one more achievement but we don't talk about that one.*
* Added 5 new flowers.
  *   Spectranthemum, functional, teleports items from around it to a defined point in the world. (Elven Knowledge)
  *   Medumone, functional, freezes mobs in place.
  *   Marimorphosis, functional, turns standard vanilla Stone into colored, decorative, stone variants depending on biome.
  *   Narslimmus, generating, kills natural spawned slimes in slime chunks for mana, doesn't drop slimeballs or split them in two.
  *   Spectrolus, generating, uses all 16 colors of wool sequentually to create mana.
* Added a "Complex Brews" page, with 6 new brews, 5 featuring new potion effects.
  *   Overload: A bunch of effects, Strength, Speed, Weakneess and Hunger.
  *   Crossed Souls: Killing a mob gives the killer a bit of their HP.
  *   Feather Feet: Fall damage immunity.
  *   Vanity's Emptiness: Prevents mob spawns in a 128 block radius.
  *   Crimson Shade: Removes mob spawn restrictions in a 64 block radius. (eg. Mobs can spawn in broad daylight, slimes in non-slime chunks, etc)
  *   Marine Allure: Doubles the speed at which fishing rods work.
* Added a Gaia Spirit Ingot, used to summon a hard mode Gaia Guardian, it's harder, better, faster and stronger. It also drops moar lootz.
* Added Ancient Wills. Items that can crafted with a Terrasteel Helmet to provide for very powerful abilities. How do you get them? Who knows.
* Added armor set bonuses to sets of mana armor that apply when all 4 pieces are equipped.
  *   Manasteel: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools.
  *   Elementium: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools, pixies apply random potion effects.
  *   Terrasteel: 10% Mana Discount for Mana Tools, regeneration still works even when the food bar isn't topped off.
* Added Crafting Patterns, upgrades of sorts to the Crafty Crate which prevent items from going into slots. There's 9 basic ones that can be used for simple recipes: 1x1, 2x2, 1x2, 2x1, 1x3, 3x1, 2x3, 3x2 and Donut.
* Added Dreamwood Twigs, used to craft Elementium Tools instead of Livingwood Twigs.
* Added Mana Diamond and Dragonstone storage blocks.
* Added Overgrowth Seeds. A new dungeon loot item that allows you to enchant a piece of grass, making any flowers on it work at twice the speed.
* Added Sanity Checks to the lexicon GUIs to prevent crashing if one tries to open a page that doesn't exist. This is important for third party minetweaker support. (SoundLogic)
* Added Spellbinding Cloth. Combine it with an item to remove any enchants it has. *This one actually is a carbon copy of the one in Thaumic Tinkerer, this item is like a legacy in my mods. Surprised I hadn't stolen it from TT yet :V*
* Added the Lens Clip, an addon to the Mana Blaster that allows it to carry 6 lenses rather than just 1.
* Added the Manaseer Monocle, a new amulet bauble that allows the wearer to see mana bursts even if there's something blocking the view.
* Added the Rod of the Depths, a variant to the Rod of the Lands that places cobblestone.
* Added the Rod of the Molten Core. Almost a carbon copy of the Efreet's Flame Wand Focus from Thaumic Tinkerer. Look at a block and hold it to smelt it.
* Added the Thorn Chakram. A throwable weapon that bounces off blocks. *Yes, it's from terraria, shut up.*
* Added the World Seed. A new (stackable) item that can be used to instantly teleport to the world's spawn point case the user is at least 24 blocks away.
* Added Trodden Dirt Slabs.
* Baubles now detect the "first tick" using hash codes. This is a lot more reliable than using the old entity time method.
* Changed some lexicon text to make more sense on the small details.
* Changed the Gaia Guardian's Landmine particles to look a bit better and not be as tricky to spot.
* Changed the Trodden Dirt recipe to use Sand instead of Gravel.
* Fixed a crash regarding dominant sparks when there's no other sparks available for transfer.
* Fixed dying Composite Lenses removing the composite component.*Took me long enough.*
* Fixed the Abstruse Platform recipe having stack size 0 for the components and causing divide by zero crashes with the NEI shift-[?] feature. *(Why does that even check the stack size? O.o)*
* Fixed the Assembly Halo consuming Blood Magic orbs and potentially other items whose container item is the item itself.
* Fixed the Life Imbuer spawning client-side only mobs.
* Fixed the Mana Enchanter and Mana Flash blocks appearing in the search creative tab.
* Fixed the Red String Container not passing markDirty() calls to the bound block and causing it not to sync to the client.
* Fixed the Ring of Far Reach adding insane amounts of reach if one travels between dimensions.
* Fixed the Ring of Far Reach removing flight *(and breaking whatever arcane sorcery was behind the Angel Ring in Extra Utils)*.
* Fixed the Soulscribe being able to automatically repair with mana like a Manasteel Sword can.
* Fixed the Terra Shatterer not breaking blocks in AoE at X=0 or Z=0.
* Fixed the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate desyncing if the server is lagging and potentially destroying all the mana used if one picks up the item too early in those circumstances.
* Made the Black Lotus rarely appear in Bonus Chests.
* Made the Fallen Kanade not work in the end to prevent cheesing the Ender Dragon.
* Mana Sparks now try to update the list of sparks they can transfer to after they're done ticking. Dominant Sparks will also attempt to pull mana from sparks at random rather than iteratively. When a Mana Pool with a Dominant Spark is charging an item and is full, instead of pulling from one Mana Pool exclusively it randomly pulls from all possible pools around.
* Mana Tablets now render on the player's belt, if there's one.
* Mana tools now have right click abilities. The Pickaxe places a torch from the inventory, the Axe does the same for a sapling and the Shovel works as a Hoe.
* Nerfed the Bands of Aura. A lot.
* Removed the health boost from Terrasteel Armor.
* Removed the item name remapper. It's completely useless at this point unless by some reason you're updating from a 10 month old build. It was also breaking downgrading as it was trying to remap items that didn't exist. 
* Removed the transparency in the HUD mana bars, as it looked absolutely god awful in higher resolutions/scales.
* The Elementium Pickaxe (and Elementium Tipped Terra Shatterer) will now look in the ore dictionary for what blocks not to break. Should help with Underground Biomes and other mods that add new stones.
* The Lexica Botania's in hand animation uses partial ticks now and isn't locked to 20fps any more. It looks so much smoother. *GLORIOUS 60FPS PC MASTER RACE*
* The Mana Prism can now be turned off with a redstone signal.
* The Tiny Potato can now be named in an anvil. It can also sing.
* Trodden Dirt now expands to a full block if there's a block above it.
* [API] Added IBurstViewerBauble for a bauble that acts as the Manaseer Monocle.
* [API] Added IManaDiscoutArmor. Pretty self explanatory.
* [API] Added methods to ManaItemHandler for handling mana discount for tools.
* [API] Added remove() to LexiconRecipeMappings. (SoundLogic)
* [API] Updated version number to 30.

* Added the Black Lotus, a dungeon loot consumable that can be tossed onto a Mana Pool for a boost of mana.
* Added the Mana Prism, a new block that can change the properties of a Mana Burst on the fly.
* Added Trodden Dirt, a new block that looks great for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path">desire paths</a>. It also gives a slight speed boost. The texture and idea come from <a href="http://redd.it/2sqwu6">/u/LupusX's post on reddit</a>.
* Red String Spoofers will now also connect to mushrooms.
* Shifted the Assembly Halo HUD down 10px so it fits on smaller resolution/render scales.
* The Brewery and Enchanter now have the same progress pie as the Runic Altar.
* The Magnet Ring will no longer pull items that can contain mana, items that are on a terrasteel plate or AE2 crystal seeds.
* (Technical) IManaTrigger blocks with IManaCollisionGhost tile entities will still have their effect triggered. Furthermore IManaTrigger triggers for fake bursts too so that should be checked against.
* [API] Added IManaDissolvable and IDyablePool.
* [API] Increased version number to 29.

* Fixed a crash when using the crafting halo to make extra utils unstable ingots.
* Fixed more tpyos. *This is becoming a dank meme.*

* Fixed the Mana Fluxfield not sending energy to every RF receiver. (yueh)
* Fixed the Mana Fluxfield requiring the CoFH API to be present to work rather than the CoFH Energy API. (Vexatos)
* Fixed tools that break multiple blocks (manasteel shovel, terra shatterer) causing dupes with thermal expansion tanks and strongboxes and potentially other blocks that require exact harvest method call order.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 149" %}

* Fixed Dominant Sparks being able to pull from blocks other than Mana Pools.
* Fixed Flashes dropping themselves.
* Moved the following flowers to elven knowledge: Thermalily, Kekimurus, Heisei Dream, Orechid, Loonium.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 148" %}

* *I could have fit this on 147 but I only decided to do it later :V*
* Added support for [Colored Lights](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445251-1-7-10-beta-wip-colored-light-progress-and). ([Picture 1](http://puu.sh/dKo8o/7c34ca4d3d.png)) ([Picture 2](http://puu.sh/dKozh/323db4f589.png)) You can find it in the following blocks:
  *   Glimmering Flowers
  *   Floating Flowers (colored normal ones only)
  *   Buried Petals
  *   Sea Lanterns
  *   Flashes
* Buried petals now emit a faint light.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 146" %}

* *Added some christmas spark. ARE YOU JINGLING YOUR BELLS YET?!*
* Fixed a major dupe with the Assembly Halo where right clicking a recipe would allow for more than one item to be crafted at once using only one set of resources.
* Fixed the render for the flowers not randomizing the position in the Z axis like vanilla flowers do. It still randomizes in the Y axis unlike vanilla flowers because I think it looks good.
* Sparks now properly check against how much space is left on the target block and don't try to put in more mana than available, actually making spark networks viable. *You can all point and laugh now.*
* The Assembly Halo is now more forceful with checking the validity of a recipe. It can no longer craft recipes purely from memory (and allowing as a way to craft things that have been changed since)
* The Mana Mirror now checks for the pool on update and has a backlog for calls inbetween. It also works cross dimension a lot better.
* [API] Added getAvailableSpaceForMana() to ISparkAttachable. This is very important and breaks backwards compatibility. If anyone is using that interface please adapt ASAP.
* [API] Increased version number to 28.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 145" %}

* Added the Mana Lens: Flash. It makes fancy lights!

---

* Fixed the Halo on the Flugel wings rendering 1.62 blocks higher than normal on other players in multiplayer.
* Fixed the Rod of the Arcane Barrage crashing servers >_>

* [API] Added IBaubleRender.
* [API] SubTileEntities now have an internal ticker.

* Fixed the Rod of the Skies and Hells not showing a mana bar. 
* The enchanter will now always properly reset the pylons' particle emitting status.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 137" %}

* Fixed RedStringRenderer looking for the codechicken Vector3 rather than the botania one. On other words, Fixed the game crashing if you have a wand of the forest equipped while you have a red string block in the world and codechickencore isn't installed.
* Fixed the Red Stringed Spoofer not being in the creative tab.
* Fixed the Terra Shatterer not actively restoring its damage like the manasteel tools do.
* Fixed the recipes for breaking back Reed and Thatch blocks giving items with metadata 1, and thus unusable.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 136" %}

* **Added Red String and Red Stringed Blocks**. These can interact with other blocks remotely.
* Calling setWater on the petal apothecary now calls for a block update. *This is technical stuff for other modders only.*
* Changed some minor details in some lexicon entries so they are accurate to recent changes.
* Changed the brewery texture to a more appropriate one. (Yulife)
* Combining a Floating (any color) Flower with any botania flower with an effect (manastar, pure daisy, any generating or functional...) will replace the flower there with the one you put. The flower will still act like normally, but has the visual and technical properties of a Floating Flower.
* Fixed mod slabs letting light pass through.
* Fixed some tpyos in the elven lore page. *I desperately need someone to proofread the nonsense I write.*
* Fixed the game crashing if one tries to look up uses for the Tainted Blood Pendant in NEI.
* Fixed the runic altar not saving the amount of mana it should get (and thus causing the amount of mana it has to reset to 0 when it loads back).
* Fixed there being a missing texture on the terra plate, resulting in some unneeded log errors.
* Having Night Vision on a Tainted Blood Pendant will no longer make the brightness blink obnoxiously.
* Hopefully fixed entry sharing being somewhat fiddly in SMP.
* Removed the text that says that Bursts would work in the Terrasteel crafting, because it seems everyone gets confused and decides not to use sparks even though it clearly says it's the best way >.<
* The Terra Shatterer should no longer break blocks on the client side only and require a relog.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 135" %}

* Added some more info to the Spark page.
* Fixed the terrasteel plate not being in the creative tab.
* Fixed the terrasteel plate not taking the player to the Terrasteel entry when shift-right clicked with the lexicon.
* Removing sparks is now done via shift-right click, normal right click now shows which sparks it can connect to.
* The Gaia Guardian now spawns a few less mobs and spawns them in a smaller radius. It won't spawn pig zombies or spiders any more, but you might get witches.
* When a spark is placed in the world it displays what sparks it can connect to, this can be duplicated by right clicking it with a wand.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 134" %}

* Fixed crash when looking at a mana pool if dark quartz is disabled in the config.
* Fixed the terrasteel plate taking mana from spreaders even if it isn't active.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.3 133" %}

* **Build 132 was supposed to be 1.3, not this, but this one works too.** *All this stuff was to be in 132 but I wanted to play The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, since that came out, y'know...*
* **1.7.2 is no longer supported.**
* Added a Brew of Restoration, it's like the brew of Revitalization but it's Regeneration I for 2 minutes and uses redstone in the crafting.
* Added new lore/backstory pages for the events that separated the elves' world from the overworld. It's worth a read, but not required. Some text in the original entries was also changed to reflect.
* Added the Tainted Blood Pendant, it can store potions and give the player their effects while it's worn, for the cost of mana.
* Added the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate, which serves as the new method to create Terrasteel. You'd be wise to look at the Terrasteel page to check out how it works. It's pretty similar to the old method but allows for more control and can be done earlier in the game.
* Changed the Gaia Guardian fight a whole bunch, it's harder now to compensate for the new items and the fact that it can take damage from the Terra Blade now. Brews and a Terra Blade are a must now. The entry in the lexicon now describes the recommended gear. You can see what it does for yourself ;)
* Fixed the Alfglass recipe using Glass instead of Managlass as it should.
* Fixed the Brew of Mending not working.
* Fixed the Brewery breaking instantly. Added added the proper block texture for breaking.
* Fixed the Brewery's rendering going all over the place if you placed a block on it.
* Fixed the console getting spammed when using the Rod of the Black Mesa. *smh flaxbeard*
* Fixed the Gaia Guardian being able to teleport outside the bounds of the arena.
* Fixed the Gaia Guardian despwaning if the last player in the world logged out.
* Fixed the Gaia Guardian's HP bar showing the sinusoid for the first guardian spawned if multiple guardians were spawned in the same play session.
* Fixed the lexicon gui showing the recipe for an item that's not the one being hovered above if the two happen to intersect. (see Terrasteel page)
* Fixed the Mana Pool (with Alchemy Catalyst) not being able to break down quartz blocks into their components.
* Fixed the Ring of Magnetization pulling items in the cilent side only when in a dedicated server.
* Fixed tucking fypos. Again.
* If the summoning of a Gaia Guardian fails, a chat message is now sent describing why.
* Increased the max amount of mana a Terra Shatterer can hold up to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE">2147483647</a>. If you manage to reach this value you also get a fancy congratulatory message.
* Lexicon Entries containing documents from Elven Garde now have a special type of paper.
* The arena for the Gaia Guardian is now round, not square.
* Trying to infuse an item that isn't a Diluted Mana Pool in a Diluted Mana Pool will show a yellow check with a line rather than just a green check.
* When fighting the Gaia Guardian there's now an indicator to where the arena ends.
* [API] Addded setNotBloodPendantInfusable() to Brew to allow brews to not be infused in the Tainted Blood Pendant.
* [API] Added elfPaperTextPage() to IInternalMethodHandler.

* [API] Increased version number to 23.
* [API] LexiconCategory now implements Comparable, has a sorting priority int and keeps count on how many were added for addon makers to be able to have their entries be sorted. The default (and used by botania categories) is 5, entries like basics and misc use 9 and 0, respectively. Use setPriority() to set.

* The Gaia Traps (purple spots the Gaia Guardian summons) now only blind for a fraction of a second instead of four seconds.
* The Rod of the Lands no longer works below sea level (Y = 62), this is to prevent it from being used as a ghetto underground quarry.

* The Shard of Laputa is now upgradable using aditional Gaia Spirits, each one increases the radius by 1 block, up to 20 can be used.

* Changed the recipe for the Pyroclast Pendant to make more sense with the recent nerf.
* The Pixies the Gaia Guardian spawns no longer take non-player damage, so you can't cheese the battle with Tiny Planet + Terra Blade. *Sorry Lewis :3*

---

* Hopperhocks will no longer pick items up right after a mana pool crafts them.
* I was playing with TC and realized I wanted Botania armor mixed in with the Goggles of Revealing, so you can do that now.

* Lowered default flower quantity and density to 2 and 16 respectively (was 3 and 32).
* Lowered default villager shed avg interval from 82000 to 226000 (this won't affect old configs).
* The Hopperhock is now more efficient at picking up items and picks up any it can find instead of just one at a time, this makes automating systems that require timing a lot easier.
* The Hopperhock now respects inventory max stack sizes.
* The Mana Enchanter is more expensive and puts less empahsis in the rarity of the enchantment.
* The Mana Pool no longer has a cooldown between being able to craft items but rather a timer on when it can "re-craft" an item after it crafted it (see wood log transmutation for example).

* The Snowflake Pendant no longer creates ghost ice blocks in the client and is now properly centered on the player.

* Added two new lenses: The Kindle and Force lenses, which, respectively, set blocks on fire and move them like a piston.
* Changed the recipe for the Phantom Lens since that recipe is now used for the Force Lens.

* Renamed "Mystical Instruments" to "Mystical Items", because it makes more sense and is less confusing.
* The Petal Apothecary now has a smarter checking for what it considers seeds. Read: Natura Hop*seed* wood won't work now :p
* Tweaked the Mana Burst particles, now they never leave any empty space between them, so you get a proper straight burst when you fire it with a mana blaster instead of a bunch of loose particles. The color and size also randomizes a bit to make each burst distint, even if just by a bit.

---

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.1 83" %}

* Changed the Lexicon HUD icon to be a lot less intrusive.
* Fixed Gaia Pylons' in-world lexicon click going to the wrong entry.

* The Flugel Tiara is now made with Elementium.

* The Mana Detector now emits some red particles while it's emiting a redstone signal.

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.1 70" %}

* **Massively optimized the particle render code.** Botania particles will no longer kill your fps. In doing this they also render properly over water now, so that's neat. *Yo Azanor, you should do this too for nitor.*
* Added <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/484136285251309568">Matrix Mode</a> as a config option. This was a visual glitch I got while changing the particle code that I decided to leave in because it was funny.

---

* Fixed lack of canUpdate() override on TileManaVoid, in theory this shouldn't impact performance unless you somehow had hundreds of them, but it fixes MCPC+ complaining. */shrug.*

{% include changelog_header.html version="r1.0 55" %}

* Added some sanity checking to the flowers' connection code to reflect the changes in 54, be it for Spreaders or Pools. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog. I can't exactly tell you if that is the case though, because this issue is completely sporadic and nigh-on impossible to reproduce with consistency. ***Warning**: This change modifies API files SubTileGenerating.java and SubTileFunctional.java.
