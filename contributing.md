Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. Great. Here's what you have to do:
* Have a look through the [Botania FAQ](http://vazkii.us/mod/Botania/faq.php), to see if your issue has been solved already;
* Read through the steps on [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/);
* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding MCPC+/Cauldron that are not reproducible with forge only are **not accepted**;
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the mod are **not accepted**;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed without asking.
  * Do not tag your issues' names. "Something Broke" is prefered to "[Bug] Something Broke"  because there's a proper label system in place.
* [Report the Issue](https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/issues)!

Ideas I do not have any intention of adding or don't like will be closed.
You can find me at most times on [#vazkii @ irc.esper.net](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=vazkii), if you need to speak with me about the issue you would report.
